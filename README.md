# Prerequisites
First, you must have docker and git installed.

## Installation
Run these commands:

### Download the API
`git clone https://github.com/jspranklemusic/sample-rails-react-crud-server.git`
### Download the Client
`git clone https://github.com/jspranklemusic/sample-rails-react-crud-client.git`
### Run the docker containers
`cd sample-rails-react-crud-client`
`docker-compose up --build`

## Notes
This is a test project to use Ruby on Rails, Docker, and React together for a coding challenge. There are many practices that should be altered in order to make this production ready. For instance, the client accesses a hard-coded port 3000.
